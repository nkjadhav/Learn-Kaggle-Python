Let's start with a simpler version...\n`7-3` is of course just 3 subtracted from 7: 4. The key is what happens when we add another `-`.\n\n`7--3` is `10`. To match how Python evaluates this expression, we would parenthesize it as `7-(-3)`. The first `-` is treated as a subtraction operator, but the second one is treated as *negation*. We're subtracting negative 3 (which is equivalent to adding 3). Subsequent `-`s are all treated as additional negations, so they cause the subtracted quantity to flip back and forth between 3 and negative 3. Therefore, when there are an odd number of `-`s, the expression equals 4. When there's an even number, the expression equals 10.",
            "text/markdown": "<span style=\"color:#33cc33\">Correct:</span> \n\nThe original expression's value is `10`. If we had used 99 `-`s, the expression's value would be 4. But why? Let's start with a simpler version...\n`7-3` is of course just 3 subtracted from 7: 4. The key is what happens when we add another `-`.\n\n`7--3` is `10`. To match how Python evaluates this expression, we would parenthesize it as `7-(-3)`. The first `-` is treated as a subtraction operator, but the second one is treated as *negation*. We're subtracting negative 3 (which is equivalent to adding 3). Subsequent `-`s are all treated as additional negations, so they cause the subtracted quantity to flip back and forth between 3 and negative 3. Therefore, when there are an odd number of `-`s, the expression equals 4. When there's an even number, the expression equals 10.\n"

It does the following:\n\n1. Get a random number of sketches from some category (e.g. bears, stars, hockey sticks...)\n2. Create variables `rows`, `cols`, `height`, and `width`, setting them to numbers we pulled out of the air.\n3. Calls `plt.subplots()` using the variables from step 2, which creates a grid with the given characteristics.\n4. Draws the sketches from step 1 in the grid from step 3.\n\nTry running the cell a few times to see it in action."

      "source": "You may have noticed a few problems (with accompanying warning messages printed out):\n\n- We wanted each image to be drawn in a square (with width and height of 2 inches), but they're being drawn inside fat rectangles.\n- Our grid can only fit at most 15 images. If we sample more than that, only the first 15 are shown.\n- If we sample a small number of images, we waste a lot of space.\n\nAll these problems stem from our shoddy approach to step 2 in the code. Instead of using the same grid dimensions every time, they should adapt to the number of images we're showing. For example, if `n = 3`,  we should make a 6\" x 2\" grid with 1 row and 3 columns. If `n = 15`, we should make a 16\" x 4\" grid with 2 rows and 8 columns. (We'll have one empty space in the grid, but that's okay, as long as we don't have whole rows or columns that are empty.)\n\nUpdate the code above to fix the values of `rows`, `cols`, `width`, and `height`, so that our grid adapts to the number of images shown and makes efficient use of space. Run your code a few times to make sure it doesn't generate any warnings.\n\n<small>**Note**: I'm intentionally glossing over the details of steps 1, 3, and 4 of the code. If you're curious about how the functions we imported such as `sample_images_of_category`, or `draw_images_on_subplots` work, you can check out their definitions [here](https://github.com/Kaggle/learntools/blob/master/learntools/python/quickdraw.py). The code uses lots of syntax and data structures that we'll cover later, so if it looks like gibberish to you at this point, don't worry. We will *not* be going into the specifics of data visualization using matplotlib or any other library in this course. But fortunately, we have a [course on Kaggle Learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualisation) on just that topic.</small>"

They're mostly aimed at experienced Python coders who are taking the Python course as a refresher. If that doesn't describe you, feel free to skip this one.</small>\n\nSuppose we want to create two variables, `a` and `b`, both initialized to 0. The obvious way to do this would be...\n\n```python\na = 0\nb = 0```\n\nBut if you've read a lot of Python code, you may be aware of the following nifty shortcut:\n\n```python\na = b = 0\n```\n\nCan you think of a case where it makes a difference which syntax we use, when initializing two variables to the same value?"

This matters if that object is of a **mutable** type, like list. Consider the following code:\n```python\nodds = evens = []\nfor i in range(5):\n    if (i % 2) == 0:\n        evens.append(i)\n    else:\n        odds.append(i)\nprint(odds)\nprint(evens)```\n\nWe might expect this would print `[1, 3]`, then `[0, 2, 4]`. But actually, it will print `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` twice in a row. `evens` and `odds` refer to the same object, so appending an element to one of them appends it to both of them. This is occasionally the source of hair-pulling debugging sessions. :)\n\nAnother consideration is expressions that have side effects. For example, `list.pop` is a method which removes and returns the final element of a list. If we have `L = [1, 2, 3]`, then `a = b = L.pop()`, will result in `a` and `b` both having a value of 3. But running `a = L.pop()`, then `b = L.pop()` will result in `a` having value 3 and `b` having value 2.",

First, you'll need to save a version of your notebook that shows your current work by hitting the \"Commit & Run\" button. (Your work is saved automatically, but versioning your work lets you go back and look at what it was like at the point you saved it. It also let's you share a nice compiled notebook instead of just the raw code.) Then, once your notebook is finished running, you can go to the Settings tab in the panel to the left (you may have to expand it by hitting the [<] button next to the \"Commit & Run\" button) and setting the \"Visibility\" dropdown to \"Public\".\n\n# Keep Going\n\nWhen you're ready to continue, [click here](https://www.kaggle.com/colinmorris/functions-and-getting-help) to continue on to the next tutorial on functions and getting help."
